      by examining them.

  - admin: The Player Panel should now contain the unique mob tag associated to a
      certain mob that a player might inhabit at one time, which is stored on their
      player details datum on their client (which is guaranteed to always exist).
  - admin: The "Old Names" details of a player is now visible in their own personal
      per-player player panel.
  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to
      a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it
      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.
  - bugfix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you were
      to use it, but instead do their own unique thing.
